   Welcome to the website of the Mount Carmel HS Robotics Club. We are an FTC team
based out of San Diego, California, and have competed annually in our local FTC
Competition for four years. We use a combination of programming and design work 
to build a robot which competes against other schools and organizations in a 
yearly global competition. For more information about our club, click on the side
links, or view news and challenge updates below. Contact information for both the
team leaders and the web designers are on the left in case you have any questions
about either the club or FTC.

            <h3>Team Organization</h3><br>
            At Team Uncopywrightable, we believe that, due to larger size of our team than many of our competitiors, that having every member specialize in a specific field is most efficient, so that we don't have a large amount of our members unable to work. We divide into a build team and and a programming team, with some members opting for more specialized roles such as Design. We also have a seperate organizational system for the team as a club, and have a Logistics, PR, and IT team. Our leadership structure consists of officers in charge of both parts of the team and parts of the club. Below, we have a list of the elected officers, and a short description of each position.
