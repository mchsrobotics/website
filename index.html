   Welcome to the website of the Mount Carmel HS Robotics Club. We are an FTC team
based out of San Diego, California, and have competed annually in our local FTC
Competition for four years. We use a combination of programming and design work 
to build a robot which competes against other schools and organizations in a 
yearly global competition. For more information about our club, click on the side
links, or view news and challenge updates below. Contact information for both the
team leaders and the web designers are on the left in case you have any questions
about either the club or FTC.
